**Flash Panel Board**

Front Panel Board (FPB) is an electronics board composed of a set of visible and IR leds, in addition, it contains a cube mirror. The main goal of visible leds is to flash the light when the satellite is over the horizon, in order to facilitate satellite detection by the telescope. The main goal of the IR LEDs is to transmit information from space to earth. Finally, the main task of a cube mirror is to reflect an incoming laser light and reflect it back to the incoming point.
